I created a dockerfile for a free-time application that I have been working on: https://github.com/leoalho/hyperset. Joukko is a multiplayer game loosely based on the card game Set.\
I used the same application for Exercise 1.15 by publishing it to docker hub. For this exercise I created a dockerfile and launched the application via fly.io. Launching a dockerized application with fly is rather straightforward. It requirers instaling flyctl, a CLI for communicating eith fly.io and applications launched wit fly.io. When building an application with fly.io, it automatically detects the dockerfile and requirers minimal input from the user. To get the application working I had to do slight changes in the fly.toml-file which is a file for configuring the fly application (the fly.toml file is gitignored in the repository linked above). I mainly added environmental variables needed for the application to connect to the database. I also added the db password via fly SECRETS for safety reasons.
